Hi there! My name is Janis, I am currently studying Management and Computer Science at TUM in beautiful Munich. 

This is my blog about my journey of embarking into the world of Python and Machine Learning. I am hoping that the posts help other people just like me to make the journey easier and learn from the lessons I have learned. 

Feel free to contact me via email if you have ideas for a collaboration. I am always open to new adventures.
