Hi there! My name is Janis, I am currently studying Management and Computer Science at TUM in beautiful Munich. 

This is my blog about my journey of embarking into the world of Python and Machine Learning. I am hoping that the posts help other people just like me to make the journey easier and learn from the lessons I have learned. 

Feel free to contact me via email if you have ideas for a collaboration. I am always open to new adventures.

            debugMode: true,
            welcomeMessage: 'Welcome to bashme, the first command line interface about you. Please type `help` to get started'
        });
