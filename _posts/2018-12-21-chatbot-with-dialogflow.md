Recently, my employer, Senacor Technologies, gave me the chance to work on a project of my own choice for a day. We call these 24h Sprints and they are usually a great way to discover new technologies. And that's what I did with a colleague of mine. We wanted to build a chatbot with Dialogflow by Google to help our internal company IT-support with a chatbot that could answer the most frequenty asked questions.

My colleage, Tobias, and I had noticed that many colleagues post into the Slack IT-Support channel while asking similar questions. These questions were along the lines of: *If I make a call to Austria, how much does that cost?* / *How can I change my password when I am not connected to the company intranet?*

So, why not save some valuable of time and let Geoffrey handle these questions?! You might ask youself, who is Geoffrey? Geoffrey is our chatbot and aid in all things related to IT-support. You want to know how to install a printer under Windows or Mac? Ask Geoffrey! You want to know about the details of your company mobile contract? Geoffrey knows the answer. And if I just want to see a random GIF from 9gag? Yep, Geoffrey can do that, too.
