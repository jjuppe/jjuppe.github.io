# What is Anaconda?

You might ask yourself: what is Anaconda? Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of python. It comes already with a lot of useful packages for data science installed. For further detail check out [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/).

# How to install Anaconda?
Go to their [website](https://www.anaconda.com/) to download the installer for the respective operations system. You can check whether the installation was succesful by typing the following into your console:
```python
conda -V
```
You can also open up the Anaconda Navigator to see which packages are installed. In the following I will mention the most used packages that come with the Anaconda distribution: NumPy, Pandas and scikit-learn. With these three packages you are good to do your own first machine learning problems. 

# Included packages
## NumPy
NumPy is a package that helps you n-dimensional data structures like arrays and offers some useful built-in functions for these.
## Pandas
Pandas is a library that offers easy to use data structures and data analysis and visualization tools. 
## Matplot lib
Matplotlib is Python 2D plotting library which produces high-quality figures and grpahs. 
## scikit-learn
